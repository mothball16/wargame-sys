SHOOTY STEPS (from request to projectile destruction)

relevant:
TurretBase - composition root of turret behaviors
AmmoContainer - one of the submodules created inside TurretBase
ProjectileController - persistent client-side projectile controller

pipeline:
1. TurretBase reads input, asks AmmoContainer to give it a rocket of <type>
2. AmmoContainer searches for first rocket of <type>, and returns rocket or nil
3. TurretBase either invalidates the request (no rocket), or tells ProjectileController to fire a rocket
4. ProjectileController creates the projectile, and performs a lookup for the projectile's AmmoConfig
5. ProjectileController either invalidates the request (no ammoconfig), or creates a Projectile object
6. ProjectileController attaches behaviors (as specfied in config) to the Projectile object, and then initiates OnFire from the config
7. Projectile's OnFire runs until it determines it had hit something/ended its lifespan
8. Projectile's OnHit runs
9. Projectile is destroyed

revisions on OnHit
- OnHit should be accessible from the config itself
- it should mostly be a server thing, with something for the client optionally that we can pass to the end of our projectile behavior

revisions on Config/Required/Prefab responsibilities
- required: ONLY should hold either state or object values. No configuration is to be performed through the required folder.
- config: Used for component configurations. STRICTLY cannot be responsible for any initialization.
- prefab: Used for entire system configuration, including addition and removal from the object registry. Defines which configs to use for
  a set of components, with the assumption that whatever controller takes the prefab will know what to do with it.

todo for ObjectRegistry/ObjectLifetimeListener/ObjectInitializer relationship
- there is way too much indirection going on with this an ObjectLifetimeListeners have their own registry. this is dumb

separation of concerns between required and module configs
- required should only be used for:
  - physical connections to parts (objectValues)
  - persistent state (attributes)
  - hot-swappable modules (UI handler, joystick, etc.) (objectValue pointing to modules)
- otherwise, use module configs

issues regarding particle replication
- the turret motor is driven solely on clients for instant client replication, but this means when the 
server fires off particles given the part, it'll fire it off from the spot on the server (not-rotated)
- since the server holds the authority on where this particle comes from, with particles wwith AvoidDestruction
(makes a new part and parents outside the model), the particle will not show from the replicated position but 
from the server position
- current ideas: instead of making the server create the part for 100% consistency, we could just run a check on other
clients and toss out packets where the part has been destroyed. as for destruction, parenting into ReplicatedStorage
on the server-side for a couple seconds should give time for replication to process and reparent particles, with omega
laggy people just invalidating the request
